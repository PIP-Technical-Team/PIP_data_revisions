Welcome to the PIP data updates page. This site tracks the revisions that have been made to the data in the World Bank’s [Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP)](https://pip.worldbank.org/home). 

The [PIP Updates](dataupdates.html) option at the top menu, provides record of all the **overall changes**, updates, and corrections to the PIP data. In a typical year, there are two major updates (March/April and September/October), which bring in new survey data. These updates are documented in [What’s New](https://pip.worldbank.org/publication) documents (published in the Global Poverty Monitoring Technical Notes series). When necessary, intermediate updates are made to correct errors as soon as possible, which are also documented in this site.

The [Country Data Revisions](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/pip_country_data_revisions) tool to tracks all the **specific changes** that country-year has undergone over time. This tool provides quick access to a summary of all the changes for a particular data point.
