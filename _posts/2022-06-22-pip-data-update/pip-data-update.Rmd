## National accounts data in Syrian Arab Republic

This update changed extrapolated estimates for Syrian Arab Republic. Prior to
this update, data on Household Final Consumption Expenditure per capita for
Syria had incorrectly been missing in the World Development Indicators,
resulting in data on GDP per capita being used instead to extrapolate Syria's
latest welfare vector (following PIP's methodology, see
[here](https://worldbank.github.io/PIP-Methodology/lineupestimates.html#nationalaccounts)
and [Prydz et al.
2019](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/664751553100573765/pdf/135460-WP-PUBLIC-Disclosed-3-21-2019.pdf)).
This has now been corrected such that data on Household Final Consumption
Expenditure per capita is used to extrapolate Syria's latest welfare vector.
