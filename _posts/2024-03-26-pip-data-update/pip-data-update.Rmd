title: "PIP data update on Mar 26, 2024"
description: |
  This update involves several changes to the data underlying global poverty estimates. Some welfare aggregates were revised, while CPI, national accounts, and population input data was updated. 101 new country-years were added, for a total of more than 2,300 surveys in PIP. For first time, PIP is reporting estimates post COVID-19 pandemic, with regional and global poverty rates up to 2022. Further details on the changes are available in [this document](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099839303252425642/idu1d671646616eef14bb31a2ba103042c40ae3c).
