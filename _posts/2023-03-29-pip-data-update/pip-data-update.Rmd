title: "PIP data update on March 29, 2023"
description: |
  This update involves several changes to the data underlying global poverty estimates. Some welfare aggregates were revised, while CPI, national accounts, and population input data were updated. 113 new country-years were added, for a total of more than 2,100 surveys in PIP. Global poverty estimates are reported up to 2019 while earlier years were revised. Regional poverty estimates in 2020 and 2021 are reported only for regions with sufficient survey data coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further details on the changes are available in [this document](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099923403272329672/IDU089370bcb048b9044fd0ab49037249b87aef6).
