      <description>This document tracks the revisions that have been made to the data in the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform. In a typical year, there are two major updates (in March/April and September/October), which bring in new survey data. These major updates are documented using a What’s New document (published in the Global Poverty Monitoring Technical Notes series). When necessary, intermediate updates are made to correct errors as soon as possible. Changes made as part of the intermediate updates are documented below.</description>

      <description>


&lt;h1 id="section"&gt;2021/06/21&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2021, minor revisions were made to four sets of survey
estimates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2021 the welfare aggregates for Honduras from 2014-2018
were revised reflecting updates to the poverty measurement methodology
(See March 2021 What’s New for details). This methodology is now also
applied to 2011-2013 to extend the comparability of the series. Minor
changes have also been made to the 2014-2015 estimates based on revised
raw data correcting previously missing values from conditional cash
transfer income. The changes to the poverty rate (using the $1.90
poverty line) are all within 2 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Nicaragua, the consumption vectors in 1993, 1998, 2001, and
2005 were updated resulting in poverty rates (using the $1.90 poverty
line) changing by less than 1 percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2021 we meant to update the income aggregate for Mexico
for the years 1989-1998 according to the SEDLAC-03 harmonization.
Erroneously, this did not happen for the 1989 survey, which has been
updated now. Details behind the changes can be found in the March 2021
What’s &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/654971615585402030/march-2021-povcalnet-update-what-s-new"&gt;New
document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have corrected a minor error in the conversion of the
Indonesian 2019 distribution from LCU to 2011 PPPs, which shifts the
mean upwards by about 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-1"&gt;2021/03/16&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 2021 global poverty update from the World Bank presents new
poverty estimates for 2019, and revises the previously published global
and regional estimates from 1981 to 2018. The update includes new
surveys that have been received and processed, including new surveys
using imputed consumption data, as well as several changes to the
existing data. Some changes reflect improvements in the welfare
aggregate based on new harmonization efforts and more available
information. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/654971615585402030/march-2021-povcalnet-update-what-s-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; outlines the changes made to the underlying data by
country, and explains the reasons why the changes have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-2"&gt;2020/09/10&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 2020 global poverty update from the World Bank mainly
involves the adoption of the revised 2011 PPPs for the estimation of
global poverty. In addition, the coverage rule for reporting regional
and global poverty aggregates has been reviewed. Historical regional and
global aggregates are now reported with an annual frequency throughout
instead of the intervals with varying lengths. Only two surveys have
been added: Nigeria (2017/2018) and Canada (2017). Some welfare
aggregates from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) have been revised.
National accounts and population input data have been updated. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/144451599591697923/september-2020-povcalnet-update-what-s-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; explains these changes in detail and the reasoning behind
them. The data are used for the analysis of global poverty in the
Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-3"&gt;2020/03/17&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 2020 global poverty update from the World Bank presents new
poverty estimates for 2018, and revises the previously published global
and regional estimates from 1981 to 2015. The update includes new
surveys that have been received and processed, as well as several
changes to the existing data. Some changes reflect improvements in the
welfare aggregate based on new harmonization efforts and more available
information. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/407961584980637951/march-2020-povcalnet-update-whats-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; outlines the changes made to the underlying data by
country, and explains the reasons why the changes have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-4"&gt;2019/09/24&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 2019 global poverty update from the World Bank includes
revised survey data which lead to minor changes in the most recent
global poverty estimates. The update includes revisions to 18 surveys
from four countries. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/344401569259571927/september-2019-povcalnet-update-whats-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; outlines the changes made to the underlying data. In this
release, we provide metadata on comparability of poverty estimates
within countries over time. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/344401569259571927/september-2019-povcalnet-update-whats-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; (section 4) provides a more detailed description of the
comparability metadata database. The database can be downloaded &lt;a
href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/home"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-5"&gt;2019/03/21&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The March 2019 global poverty update from the World Bank revises the
previously published global and regional estimates from 1981 to 2015,
using new data and surveys. The update includes 51 new surveys that have
been received and processed, as well as several changes to the existing
surveys and revised CPI, population and national accounts data. Some
changes reflect improvements in the welfare aggregate based on new
harmonization efforts and more available information. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/591411553104368000/march-2019-povcalnet-update-whats-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; outlines the changes made to the underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-6"&gt;2019/02/07&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National accounts data for Venezuela has been updated to correspond
fully to WDI series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-7"&gt;2018/09/19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The September 2018 global poverty update from the World Bank
presents new poverty estimates for 2015, and revises the previously
published global and regional estimates from 1981 to 2013. The update
includes new surveys that have been received and processed, as well as
several changes to the existing data. Some changes reflect improvements
in the welfare aggregate based on new harmonization efforts and more
available information. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/800661537207486157/september-2018-povcalnet-update-what-s-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; outlines the changes made to the underlying data by
country, and explains the reasons why the changes have been made. The
2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity report (forthcoming in mid-October)
will offer a detailed analysis of the latest trends in global and
regional poverty, including the 2015 estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this release, we also published the API for accessing the
PovcalNet directly without using the Povcalnet web pages. User can refer
the &lt;a
href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/docs/PovcalNet%20API.pdf"&gt;API
specification document&lt;/a&gt; for the syntax of API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-8"&gt;2018/04/18&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The April 2018 update to PovcalNet involves several changes to
the data underlying the global poverty estimates. We include new surveys
that we have received and processed, as well as several changes to the
existing data. Some changes reflect improvements in the welfare
aggregate based on new harmonization efforts and more available
information. Other changes involve corrections of minor errors in the
construction of the welfare aggregate. When relevant, we have also
updated some of the auxiliary data, such as the CPIs and national
accounts data. Finally, we have dropped a few surveys from the database
based on data quality concerns. &lt;a
href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/173171524715215230/april-2018-povcalnet-update-what-s-new"&gt;This
document&lt;/a&gt; details the content of and reasoning behind the changes
made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of these updates to the database, we have revised the
global and regional estimates from 1981 to 2013, originally released in
October 2016 and revised in October 2017. The World Bank’s next major
update of global and regional poverty estimates is scheduled for October
2018, where we plan to release global poverty estimates for the
reference year 2015. This will coincide with the launch of the next
Poverty and Shared Prosperity report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-9"&gt;2017/10/10&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the October 2017 update includes several methodological
changes, as well as an update of the underlying economy-level data, we
have not estimated global poverty for a new reference year. Instead, we
have updated the global and regional poverty estimates for reference
year 2013 which were originally released in October 2016. From now on,
we will report updated global poverty estimates only every two years,
coinciding with the publication of the Poverty and Shared Prosperity
reports. Changes in the global poverty estimates from one year to the
next are small, in particular when one considers the likely
uncertainties involved in these estimates. Furthermore, many developing
economies, especially those with high concentrations of extreme poverty,
lack surveys with an annual frequency. Hence, changes from one year to
the next for these economies are based on our extrapolation and
interpolation methods, which may give rise to additional estimation
errors. We plan to release global poverty estimates for reference year
2015 in October 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now report a regional poverty estimate for the Middle East and
North Africa region in reference year 2013. The surveys that we can now
include in our database account for more than 40 percent of the regional
population, which is the cut-off for reporting a regional poverty
estimate. This improvement in the population coverage reflects newly
available data, as well as the resolution of remaining issues with the
2011 PPPs in the region (see below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our global count, we no longer assume that the “other high
income economies” have no people living in extreme poverty (see the note
from 2016/10/01 below for a list of economies that are included in this
group). We had previously made this simplifying assumption of zero
extreme poverty in these economies for the global aggregate (for a
discussion &lt;a
href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10888-016-9326-6.pdf"&gt;see
Ferreira et al., 2016, p. 160&lt;/a&gt;). However, as Prof. Anthony Atkinson
has pointed out in his report of the Commission on Global Poverty, this
assumption is inconsistent with a truly global approach to poverty
measurement (&lt;a
href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25141/9781464809613.pdf"&gt;World
Bank, 2017, p. 47&lt;/a&gt;). He advised that we should bring these economies
into our scope of analysis. This is even more important, as we now
report global and regional poverty at additional higher lines (next
bullet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now report global and regional poverty estimates for two
additional poverty lines, $3.20/day and $5.50/day (both in 2011 PPPs).
Poverty estimates for these lines are reported in addition to the $1.90
International Poverty Line, which remains our headline poverty
threshold, and continues to define the World Bank’s goal of ending
global poverty by 2030. The $3.20 and $5.50 lines are based on the
national poverty lines typically found in lower- and upper-middle income
economies, respectively. The methodology for deriving these new poverty
lines is given in &lt;a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-016-9327-5?noAccess=true"&gt;Jolliffe
and Prydz (2016)&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, PovcalNet continues to allow users full
flexibility in choosing their own poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Yemen we use
regression-based 2011 PPP exchange rates estimated from a revised model.
We were concerned about the reliability of the official PPP exchange
rates in these economies, for example due to poor coverage or quality of
the underlying price collection, or large discrepancies between CPI- and
PPP-based inflation rates (see Ferreira et al., 2016). Atamanov et
al. (2017) [available by emailing the PovcalNet team] describe the model
used to predict PPP exchange rates for these economies. In the previous
update (October 2016), PovcalNet used the following PPPs for these
economies: For Lao PDR, we used the official 2011 PPP. Egypt, Iraq,
Jordan and Yemen used an older regression-based PPP, which our new PPPs
improve upon. For Myanmar, we had no household survey data
available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have removed poverty estimates for Cambodia until further
analytical work is carried out. Close examination of the household
survey and price data suggested problems with the household survey-based
welfare aggregate, producing implausibly low poverty rates. According to
these estimates, Cambodia’s poverty rate was much lower than what is
expected from its GDP per capita. Furthermore some non-income welfare
indicators are much lower in Cambodia than in economies with comparable
extreme poverty rates. We have removed the Cambodia data pending further
analytical work to improve the reliability of the household survey-based
consumption aggregate. Therefore, like any other economy without survey
data, Cambodia now enters the regional and global aggregate with the
regional (East Asia and Pacific) headcount ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PovcalNet data for several economies in East Asia and the Pacific
have been updated to incorporate a spatial adjustment of the welfare
aggregate. Adjusting for cost-of-living differences across regions
within an economy arguably results in a more accurate representation of
well-being. Furthermore, this practice is in line with the spatial
adjustments in other regions, such as Latin America, as detailed &lt;a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-016-9326-6"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Economies that were updated with a spatially-deflated welfare aggregate
include: Kiribati, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Timor-Leste,
Tonga, Tuvalu, Vietnam, Vanuatu, and Samoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data for the “other high income” economies, as well as some
of the income surveys in Europe and Central Asia, have a small number of
observations with negative incomes, which we have dropped from the
underlying database. These observations are typically the result of
negative profits for self-employed individuals. The observed negative
income is unlikely to reflect the permanent income of the household. It
also does not reflect household consumption for this year, since
households smooth their consumption from one year to the next, and
consumption expenditure by definition cannot be negative. In other
words, for those negative income households, we do not observe a level
of income or consumption expenditure that would be a good predictor of
their welfare in this year, so we exclude them from the analysis. This
is consistent with our approach adopted for economies in Latin America
and the Caribbean (&lt;a
href="https://www.cedlas.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/estadisticas/sedlac/"&gt;see
SEDLAC methodological documents, p. 20&lt;/a&gt;). We view this as a temporary
fix until we can develop a better method to impute a more meaningful
level of income or consumption for these observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 119 new household surveys have been added to the World
Bank’s global database, bringing the total count of household surveys to
1548. Many surveys have also been updated, reflecting corrections and
improvements to the data sources. In particular, all the estimates drawn
from the &lt;a href="https://www.lisdatacenter.org/"&gt;Luxembourg Income
Study&lt;/a&gt; (used for some of the “other high income economies”) have been
updated. For Haiti in 2012, we now use consumption expenditure instead
of income as the welfare measure, which dramatically reduces the
estimated poverty headcount ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CPI data are primarily taken from the World Development
Indicators. &lt;a
href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10888-016-9326-6.pdf"&gt;Ferreira
et al. (2016)&lt;/a&gt;list the economies where alternative CPIs are used. As
of October 2017, alternative CPIs (monthly CPIs) are also used for Iran
and Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-10"&gt;2016/10/01&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changes-in-purchasing-power-parities"&gt;Changes in purchasing
power parities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2016 PovcalNet update, the poverty measures for all economies
are based on consumption PPPs from the 2011 round of data collection by
the &lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp"&gt;International
Comparison Program&lt;/a&gt;. These PPP exchange rates include benchmark
economies where actual price surveys were conducted, as well as
regression-based PPP estimates where such surveys were not conducted.
Details on the regression model for the PPP estimation can be found in
&lt;a
href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/711001503680105564-0050022017/original/ICP2011GlobalReport.pdf"&gt;World
Bank (2015)&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2015 update, a number of economies had still
used the 2005 instead of 2011 PPPs. The following changes have now been
made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style="list-style-type: decimal"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, and Lao PDR, the 2005 PPPs are
replaced in this round by 2011 PPPs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For economies in the International Comparison Program region of West
Asia, 2011 regression-based consumption PPPs are used in this
round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changes-in-household-survey-data"&gt;Changes in household survey
data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 35 new household surveys have been added to the World
Bank’s global database, and over 100 other surveys have been updated.
About 1240 household surveys are used in this round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2
id="changes-in-the-cpi-population-data-and-national-accounts-data"&gt;Changes
in the CPI, population data, and national accounts data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CPI data used by PovcalNet are given here. For 116 economies,
the CPI data used for global poverty measurement are taken from the &lt;a
href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/"&gt;World
Development Indicators&lt;/a&gt;. For some economies we used alternative CPIs:
China and India use rural and urban CPIs (as provided by the national
statistics offices). Monthly CPIs are used by 25 economies; most are in
Latin America and the Caribbean. Another seven economies: Bangladesh,
Cambodia, Ghana, Iraq, Lao PDR, Malawi, and Tajikistan, use the implied,
that is, the expected CPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population data have also been updated, with changes for most
economies. In 21 economies, the changes have been particularly
significant, ranging from 0.5 million to 4.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;National accounts data have also been updated. Per capita GDP,
private consumption, and expenditure data have all been
updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="middle-east-and-north-africa-region"&gt;Middle East and North
Africa Region&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the 2016 update, a detailed reassessment of the 2011
PPPs has been conducted for Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and the Republic of
Yemen. It found that the coverage and quality of the 2011 PPP price data
for most of these economies were hindered by the exceptional period of
instability they faced at the time of the 2011 exercise of the
International Comparison Program. Moreover, using alternative
regression-based PPPs also seems to underestimate poverty substantially
in these economies, as well as in Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic
(but not in West Bank and Gaza).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exclusion of economies with problematic 2011 PPPs (Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan, and the Republic of Yemen), as well as the lack of recent
data on Algeria and Syria, imply that the remaining economies account
for only a third of the region’s population. This is less than the 40
percent threshold of regional population coverage that we impose for
reporting regional poverty estimates. Furthermore, the lack of new data
in several economies that have recently been affected by instability and
civil conflicts, could lead to a serious underestimation of regional
poverty rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a compromise between precision and coverage, regional poverty
totals and headcount ratios are not reported for the Middle East and
North Africa, but an estimate of the number of the poor for the region
is included in the global total (based on regression-based PPPs and 2011
PPPs, depending on the economy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chinas-2013-survey"&gt;China’s 2013 survey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2013 data, a large part of the decline in poverty in East
Asia and the Pacific is attributable to China and Indonesia. The 2013
household survey in China is the first integrated nationwide household
survey in the economy. This means that it is not comparable to previous
household surveys, in which rural and urban areas were sampled
separately. In addition, the most significant change in the 2013 survey
relative to previous surveys was the inclusion of imputed rents in
income and consumption aggregates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2013, China’s poverty rate at the $1.90 poverty
line declined by about 4 percentage points, of which half, that is,
about 2 percentage points, can be traced to changes in the survey
methodology. In other words, the actual poverty reduction not explained
by methodological changes was 2 percentage points between 2012 and 2013
(&lt;a
href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25078/9781464809583.pdf"&gt;see
World Bank, 2016, Table 2B.1, p. 49&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the World Bank’s poverty estimates on China are
based on grouped distributions, which are often not as precise as direct
estimates based on the full distribution of household income and
consumption aggregates. In 2013, China’s poverty headcount ratio under
the $1.90 poverty line was 2.2 percent using individual record data, as
confirmed by the National Bureau of Statistics, while it was 1.9 percent
based on grouped data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

of geographical regions and industrialized economies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, PovcalNet used the World Bank’s income classification
back to 1990 to track the Millennium Development Goals. Starting this
round, a new regional geographical classification is used. Two groups of
economies are included in the six geographical regions presented in
PovcalNet: (a) &lt;a
href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups"&gt;low-
and middle-income economies&lt;/a&gt;, and (b) economies eligible to receive
loans from the World Bank (such as Chile) and recently graduated
economies (such as Estonia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining economies have a high-income status and are reported as
the group of “Other high income” in PovcalNet. This group includes the
following economies: Andorra; Antigua and Barbuda; Aruba; Australia;
Austria; The Bahamas; Bahrain; Barbados; Belgium; Bermuda; British
Virgin Islands; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Cayman Islands; Channel
Islands; Curacao; Cyprus; Denmark; Finland; France; French Guiana;
French Polynesia; Germany; Gibraltar; Greece; Greenland; Guadeloupe;
Guam; Iceland; Ireland; Isle of Man; Israel; Italy; Japan; Korea;
Kuwait; Liechtenstein; Luxembourg; Macao SAR, China; Malta; Monaco;
Netherlands; New Caledonia; New Zealand; Norway; Oman; Portugal; Qatar;
Saint-Martin; Saudi Arabia; Singapore; Sint Maarten; Spain; St. Kitts
and Nevis; Sweden; Switzerland; Taiwan, China; Turks and Caicos Islands;
United Arab Emirates; United Kingdom; United States; and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. All economies not on this list, but included in the World
Development Indicators, are included in their respective geographical
region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changes-in-user-interface"&gt;Changes in user interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new analytical function is provided for users to analyze their own
distribution. This replaces the legacy Povcal.exe provided in the
earlier version. The data submitted to PovcalNet will not be stored by
the PovcalNet site, nor will PovcalNet do any currency conversion in the
calculation. Therefore, users should use the same currency unit in the
poverty line as in the distributional data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-11"&gt;2015/10/07&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The October 2015 update of global poverty estimates covers the
period from 1981 to 2012 and is based on 2011 PPP. A parallel site, &lt;a
href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNetPPP2005/"&gt;PovcalNetPPP2005&lt;/a&gt;,
continues to report data using 2005 PPP. However, the underlying data
used by the 2005 PPP site have not been updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global poverty line is changed from $1.25/day in 2005PPP to
$1.90/day in 2011PPP. The methodology used to derive the new line is
described in &lt;a
href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10888-016-9326-6.pdf"&gt;Ferreira
et al. (2016)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substantial update of the underlying distributional files. A
total of 1205 datasets are used in this round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPI, population and national accounts data are all
updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2005 PPP is still used for the following economies:
Bangladesh, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Lao and Jordan. These economies are
included in the regional and global aggregate (at $1.90 in 2011 PPP)
with their national headcount ratio estimated from $1.25 in 2005
PPP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has a new integrated (rural and urban areas are no longer
sampled separately) household survey starting in 2013. This new survey
is not used in the October 2015 update. For a more detailed explanation,
please see the &lt;a
href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/25078/9781464809583.pdf?sequence=24&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;2016
Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Country-level poverty estimates based on 2011 PPPs for Algeria,
Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Yemen are not available in this round because of
inexplicably large deviations between CPI and PPP inflations, outdated
surveys or major ongoing revisions to surveys, and ongoing conflicts.
While no economy-level poverty estimates are reported for these
economies, poverty estimates for these economies are calculated for
inclusion in the global aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="povcalnet-widget-goes-for-testing."&gt;2014/12/05 - PovcalNet
Widget goes for testing.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PovcalNet widget is a plugable element for doing poverty analysis
in any web pages. It can be embedded into a third-party site and used by
any user. The underline methodology and data are the same as the full
scale PovcalNet. In addition, the PovcalNet widget is implemented in
multiple languages. It can also be configured with a default economy and
default poverty line. Please see the &lt;a
href="http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/widget.htm"&gt;widget
page&lt;/a&gt; for full technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-12"&gt;2014/10/09&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire set of household surveys for the Europe and Central Asia
region has been updated by the ECA data team. This includes more than
246 surveys from almost all the 29 economies. For details of those
survey data, see ECAPOV, a database of standardized household surveys in
the Europe and Central Asia maintained by the World Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire set of household surveys for the Latin American and the
Caribbean region has been updated. This includes more than 280 surveys
from almost all the 25 economies. For details, see &lt;a
href="https://www.cedlas.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/en/estadisticas/sedlac/"&gt;SEDLAC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many new surveys have been added into PovcalNet from several
economies in East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, spanning the
period between 2010 and 2012/13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys for high-income economies have been included in this update.
User can calculate shared prosperity for those economies. However, the
estimation of the global poverty headcount assumes that nobody lives
below $1.25 a day in these economies. There are some observations with
household incomes below $1.25 per person in these economies, but
estimated per capita consumption is above this threshold for nearly
everyone. Due to some negative incomes reported in the data, some of
these economies have very large poverty gap and squared poverty gap
indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mean per capita income or consumption for the bottom 10%, 20%, …,
90% of the population is provided after the decile share table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="section-13"&gt;2014/09/09&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The household survey data for Brazil has been updated. The PNAD
data used in PovcalNet for Brazil reflects changes in the weighting of
the survey implemented by the Brazilian statistical office (IBGE) in
2013 to the yearly PNAD survey from 2001 to 2012 (nota_tecnica.pdf). In
addition, the data reflects the use of the Domicilio as the household
unit for Brazil, per agreement with the Brazilian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new algorithm is applied to calculate the income or consumption
decile. This addresses problems associated with income
concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computational problem in estimating the Watts index has been
fixed in this round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
