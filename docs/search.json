PIP provides a comprehensive view of global,\r\nregional, and country-level trends for more than 150 economies around the world.\r\nIt also allows users to set their own poverty lines, and download the resulting\r\nestimates and graphs. Users can access the poverty and inequality estimates\r\ndirectly through the R (pipR) and Stata\r\n(pip.ado) packages. Advanced users can also\r\nwork with the anonymized underlying microdata and perform their own analysis\r\n(see “Statistics Online”). In addition, PIP provides access to key publications\r\nproduced by the World Bank team on trends in and the measurement of poverty and\r\ninequality. PIP replaces PovcalNet and the Poverty and Equity Data\r\nPortal, which will be phased\r\nout by March 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
