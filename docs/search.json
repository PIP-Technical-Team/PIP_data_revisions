PIP provides a\r\ncomprehensive view of global, regional, and country-level trends for\r\nmore than 150 economies around the world. It also allows users to set\r\ntheir own poverty lines, and download the resulting estimates and\r\ngraphs. Users can access the poverty and inequality estimates directly\r\nthrough the R (pipR) and\r\nStata (pip.ado) packages.\r\nAdvanced users can also work with the anonymized underlying microdata\r\nand perform their own analysis (see “Statistics Online”). In addition,\r\nPIP provides access to key publications produced by the World Bank team\r\non trends in and the measurement of poverty and inequality. PIP replaces\r\nPovcalNet and the Poverty and\r\nEquity Data Portal, which will be phased out by March 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
