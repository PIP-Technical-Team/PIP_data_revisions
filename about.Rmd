## PIP

The Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) is an interactive computational tool
that offers users quick access to the World Bank's estimates of poverty,
inequality, and shared prosperity. PIP provides a comprehensive view of global,
regional, and country-level trends for more than 150 economies around the world.
It also allows users to set their own poverty lines, and download the resulting
estimates and graphs. Users can access the poverty and inequality estimates
directly through the R ([pipR](https://github.com/worldbank/pipr)) and Stata
([pip.ado](https://github.com/worldbank/pip)) packages. Advanced users can also
work with the anonymized underlying microdata and perform their own analysis
(see "Statistics Online"). In addition, PIP provides access to key publications
produced by the World Bank team on trends in and the measurement of poverty and
inequality. PIP replaces PovcalNet and the [Poverty and Equity Data
Portal](https://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/home/), which will be phased
out by March 2022.
